      <description>While at Omron I worked to develop a fuzzy logic framework for Omron PLCs using Structure Text language.
 Context From June, I spent three months working with Omron Australia as an engineering intern. I used my short time with Omron as an opportunity to build my professional network, and further put my name out as a professional contractor. I was fortunate enough to spend the first two months in-office, and got to know some of the Omron Melbourne staff on a deeper level.</description>
